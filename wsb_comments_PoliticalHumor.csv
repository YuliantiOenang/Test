Sorry but that's probably the most stupid thing I heard today and I've been on Reddit for over an hour now.

Religion is ""the belief in and worship of God or gods"". Where do you find god in restricting religion?

&gt;French secularism makes sense when you consider their religous backstory and the 3 estates. Religion was *inherently* political because it was a political tool used to oppress the poor.

Secularism always makes sense and when was religion not political or used to control people?

&gt;America never really cared about conceptual  democracy in principle, they viewed it as a tool to getting what they wanted (which is people fucking off and leaving them alone). So the french say true democracy is only possible through absolute secularism, and american says ""fuck democracy then, I want whatever political system minds its own fucking business about my personal life.""

You're right but the issue wasn't with leaving people alone but with the government not showing favoritism.

Whether you want equality through equal restrictions or equality through no restrictions, the government itself should be completely free from any religious influence (e.g. the in god we trust).",,,1609583048,{},ghtef9i,False,t3_koorpo,False,True,t1_ghsr935,/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/koorpo/big_brain_moment/ghtef9i/,1609583059,1,True,False,PoliticalHumor,t5_2qm21,,0,[],,

Let me ELI5 for you:

- Republican position is that abortion of a fetus is child murder

- If the above is child murder, then a fetus must logically be equal to a child (or at least in potential) in their eyes (assuming they're being honest in their intention)

- Ergo, if children are classed as a dependent, then the Republicans should be fine with counting fetuses as dependents too, since they would too be children

------

... Of course they would never actually fight for this, as the GOP aren't being honest at all. Their real stance is that they're against recreational sex, hence they can be both anti-abortion and anti-child support at once. It would be unpopular to say that though, hence they go with ""pro-life"".

If I understand what you're saying, that is not generally desirable. Outside of recessions the Federal Reserve for instance raises interest rates so the ""fire doesn't burn too hot"". Also, we're far below the golden rule level of savings in the US.

&gt;When a Minimum Annual Income was suggested in the primary by Yang, this was debated.

Stuff like this isn't debated meaningfully by politicians. It's studied by academics specializing in this subfield of economics - which is what the paper I linked is.

&gt;If there is a steady amount added, the market will increase prices and in the end there will have been only a short burst of new activity. Instead, a steady increase in the rate of pay may result in slightly more inflation, but that price inflation is always catching up to the new money in people's pockets. It never quite stabilizes.

Increases in the minimum wage have next to no effect on the price level/inflation. The downside to a minimum wage which is too high is unemployment among low skilled workers.
